# Geometry Clipmaps: Terrain Generation Research

> 🙋🏼 I'm not an expert on these topics. I recently found this [tutorial series by DitzyNinja's Godojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgv9iAdazKg) and instantly wanted to revive my Ymir repositor.

In the past I've dabbled in [tile-based chunking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3) and [Triangulated Irregular Networks](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/martin-real-time-rtin-terrain-mesh), but never had a stab at clipmaps.

These notes will serve as a way for me to deconstruct the concepts into bites, so that I (and hopefully someone reading this) can more easily digest this method of terrain generation.

## Initial understanding and assumptions
